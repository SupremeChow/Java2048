# Java2048
A rough attempt at replicating the 2048 game using Javafx

This project was made to teach myself Javafx. The game is based off the original 2048 found at https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/.

* Project has been uploaded to GitHub. At it's current state, the game works, though it does not calculate if the player wins or looses. 
  The game will function using input commands of AWSD, however Arrow key inputs DO NOT work, as they seem to focus on the buttons located at the
  bottom of the scene.
  
* The game is visually very rough. The graphics are barebone and lack animation. It also lacks any tracker for a score or notification for
  game state. In the future, I may stylize using CSS and try to animate the grid to make it more visually appealing and functional
